at first you can just settle for the naivest mental model and then learn the details of how a modern production GC would do it later The core of the Collections API should be learned without delay Map HashMap List ArrayList LinkedList and Set should be enough to get going Learn modern Java concurrency Thread is an assembly-language level primitive compared to some of the cool stuff in java.util.concurrent Learn ConcurrentHashMap Atomic* Lock Condition CountDownLatch BlockingQueue and the threadpools from Executors Good books here are those by Brian Goetz and Doug Lea As soon as you want to use 3rd party libraries you'll need to learn how the classpath works It's not rocket science but it is a bit verbose If you're a low-level C++ guy then you may find some of this interesting also Java has virtual dispatch by default The keyword static on a Java method is used to indicate a class method private Java methods use invokespecial dispatch which is a dispatch onto the exact type in use On an Oracle VM at least objects comprise two machine words of header the mark word and the class word The mark word is a bunch of flags the VM uses - notably for thread synchronization The class word you can think of as a pointer to the VM's representation of the Class object which is where the vtables for methods live Following the class word are the member fields of the instance of the object Java .class files are an intermediate language and not really that similar to x86 object code In particular there are lots more useful tools for .class files including the javap disassembler which ships with the JVM The Java equivalent of the symbol table is called the Constant Pool It's typed and it has a lot of information in it - arguably more than the x86 object code equivalent Java virtual method dispatch consists of looking up the correct method to be called in the Constant Pool and then converting that to an offset into a vtable Then walking up the class hierarchy until a not-null value is found at that vtable offset Java starts off interpreted and then goes compiled for Oracle and some other VMs anyway The switch to compiled mode is done method-by-method on a as-need basis When benchmarking and perf tuning you need to make sure that you've warmed the system up before you start and that you should typically profile at the method level to start with The optimizations that are made can be quite aggressive optimistic with a check and a fallback if the assumptions are violated - so perf tuning is a bit of an art Hopefully there's some useful stuff in there to be going on with - please comment ask followup questions.\"", 'You dont need to learn java to use hadoop You need to know linux to installand configure hadoop then you can write your map reduce jobs using the stream line api on any language which understand standard input output further you can do more complex map reduce using other libraries like hive etc even other components of hadoop like hbase cassandra also has clients on most of the languages', \""Answer 1 It is very desirable to know Java Hadoop is written in Java Its popular Sequence File format is dependent on Java Even if you use Hive or Pig you'll probably need to write your own UDF someday Some people still try to write them in other languages but I guess that Java has more robust and primary support for them Most Hadoop tools are not mature enough like Sqoop HCatalog and so on so you'll see many Java error stack traces and probably you'll want to hack the source code someday Answer 2 It is not required for you to know Java As the others said it would be very helpful depending on how complex your processing may be However there is an incredible amount you can do with just Pig and say Hive I would agree that it is fairly likely you will eventually need to write a user defined function UDF however I've written those in Python and it is very easy to write UDFs in Python Granted if you have very stringent performance requirements then a Java based MapReduce program would be the way to go However great advancements in performance are being made all of the time in both Pig and Hive So the short answer to your question is No it is not required for you to know Java in order to perform Hadoop development Source http www.linkedin.com groups Is-it-must-Hadoop-Developer-988957.S.141072851\""]""","""[None, None, None, None, ['java.lang java.util java.io', 'java.text java.math java.net java.lang.reflect java.util.concurrent'], None, None, None, None, None, None, None]""","""<java><hadoop>""","""indirect""
